# BIG Interactive — Branded & Playable (GitHub Pages Ready)
This is the **full interactive, branded** build. Deploy steps:

1) Create a GitHub repo and upload all files in this folder (contents, not the folder itself).
2) Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from a branch → Branch: `main` → Folder: `/ (root)` → Save.
3) Your link will appear at the top (e.g., https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/).

Tip: On iOS/Android, use "Add to Home Screen" for an app-like experience.
